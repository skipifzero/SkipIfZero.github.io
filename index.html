My name is Peter Hillerström, welcome to my site! I'm passionate about game development, GPU's, rendering and low-level programming. I'm a professional software engineer with an MSc in Computer Science from Chalmers University of Technology. I currently work in games, both in my spare time and as my "real" job.

In my spare time I'm currently working on a voxel-based action-adventure game with the codename __Apocatropics__. It's written in its own bespoke game engine in C-like C++ and D3D12 (some day I will write a lengthy blog post about when you should and should not write your own game engine). It's far from done, but hopefully I'll have exciting stuff to show off soon.

A few years ago I released a 3D snake game called __snakium³__. [Feel free to try it out!](https://github.com/skipifzero/snakium-cubed/releases/tag/v1-0)

Outside of work I'm a lover of fiction, movies, books, games, you name it. I especially love science fiction, both good and bad. My favourite movie is the 2001 Japanese-Polish cult-classic [Avalon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267287/).
