This page is a summary of my career so far, mainly with regards to game development and graphics programming. It mixes personal endeavours and professional jobs. If you are after a strict resume I suggest looking me up on LinkedIn.

# Pre-2012

* Played around with computers a whole bunch growing up.
* Learned programming in Java and Python.
* Made my first game (_Space Hunter_) in Java for Android, using OpenGL ES 1.0.
	* (Was available on Google Play Store, but haven't kept up with changing rules so they unfortunately took it down.)

# 2012-2017 - Chalmers University era

* Learned C __and__ C++ (they are different languages!)
* Learned modern OpenGL (3+)
* Learned CUDA
* Learned ~some~ Vulkan
* Took "Computer Graphics" and "Advanced Computer Graphics" courses.
* Was a supervisor in "Computer Graphics" for 2 years.
* Spent a summer [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) optimizing various computer vision algorithms.
* Wrote a [3D snake game](/posts/2016-05-07-snakium-cubed-release.html) in C++/OpenGL and released it.
* Wrote a [series of blog posts](http://www.skipifzero.com/posts/2016-01-31-volumetric-lighting-1.html) on volumetric lighting.
* Wrote a [real-time raytracer in CUDA](https://github.com/PetorSFZ/PhantasyEngineTestbed/releases) with some friends.
* Started writing a general purpose game engine (__PhantasyEngine__), which I still use in some capacity to this day.
* Did a master's thesis on [CUDA accelerated stereo vision](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12380/249761).
* Graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science.

# 2018-2021 - Early work years

* Worked as a consultant for [Visionists](https://web.archive.org/web/20170728170258/http://www.visionists.se/) (2018-2019).
	* Implemented some highly optimized algorithms in CUDA for Zenuity.
* Started learning Vulkan more properly
	* Read the spec, and later evaluated it as a replacement for CUDA at work.
	* Never ended up using it seriously because I found it too tedious.
* Learned Direct3D 12.
* Started writing [a cross-platform GPU API](https://github.com/PetorSFZ/sfz_tech/tree/master/Lib-ZeroG) inspired by [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx).
	* Still using it, but never ended up implementing other backends than D3D12.
* Experimented with cross-compiling my game engine __PhantasyEngine__ to Javascript/WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten).
	* It worked fairly well, but decided to drop it because I found it limiting to work with the WebGL API's.
* Finally accepted that creating a general purpose game engine is stupid, started repurposing __PhantasyEngine__ into a game specific engine for my next game project.
* Started working on my next game project, __Apocatropics__.
	* Later transitioned this into a voxel game.
* Tried out [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
	* Overall found it a decent and good language
	* I think you pay a bit too much complexity and don't gain quite enough back.
	* Not for me personally, but can definitely imagine working in a Rust codebase.
* Messed around with Apple's Metal.
	* Not an expert or anything, but I like it aside from interopping Objective-C and C++.
* Worked as a game engine/rendering engineer at Hiber (2019-2022)
	* Hiberworld is basically a Roblox clone, except it's made using web tech and runs directly in the browser with no install.
	* Was responsible for starting up and from scratch architecting their next-gen cross-platform game engine in C++.
	* The new engine was shipped literally a week before I left, I have not keept up with it since then.
	* I ended up qutting for a myriad of reasons, the primary one begin that Hiber pivoted towards NFTs and blockchain.
* Started looking at [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).
	* I love the design philosophy, and I have high hopes for this language.

# 2022 - ???? - Current

* Worked full-time on __Apocatropics__ for a few months after I quit Hiber (2022)
	* Implemented voxel raytracing in HLSL compute shaders, and managed to make it pretty fast!
	* Tried out some interesting tech, including [Sparse Voxel DAGs](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/HighResolutionSparseVoxelDAGs.pdf) from my friends at Chalmers.
* Working as game engine engineer at [Media Molecule](https://www.mediamolecule.com/) (2022 - ????)
