This page details some games I have worked on. For now, it purposefully excludes games I have worked on professionally. This might change in the future, but for now please see my career page for that.

# Current

## Apocatropics (working title)

![](/res/home/apocatropics_may2021.png width="80%" style="align=center")

An action-adventure voxel game written in C++ and rendered using D3D12. Significantly more ambitious than previous game projects and very early in development.


# Released


## [snakium³](https://github.com/SkipIfZero/snakium-cubed)

![](/res/games/snakium-cubed/img1.png width=50%)

A 3D snake game written in C++, rendered using OpenGL. Read more in the [release post](/games/2016/05/07/snakium-cubed-release.html) or on the [Github page](https://github.com/SkipIfZero/snakium-cubed).

## [Legend of Cube](https://legendofcube.github.io/)

![](/res/games/legendofcube/img1.png width=35%)

A 3d platformer made in a team as part of my bachelor's thesis. I was mainly responsible for writing the physics engine and implementing gameplay mechanics (such as jumping). All in all didn't turn out super well, but a lot of valuable lessons (especially in planning and project management) was learned.

[Available here.](https://legendofcube.github.io/)


## snakium

![](/res/games/snakium/snakium_screen1.png width=30%)
![](/res/games/snakium/snakium_screen2.png width=30%)

A nice snake clone featuring multiple game modes and very customizable rules. Made in the summer of 2013 after my first year at Chalmers. Unlike previous projects I decided to focus on something smaller in scope and instead try to do it really, really well. The focus of snakium was to make it look really good and give it a distinct style and theme. Lessons were learned from previous projects and much effort went into making the quick, tight controls of snake work on a touch device.

Features music and sound effects by [Coffer](http://coffer.se).


## Space Hunter

![](/res/games/spacehunter/img2.jpg width=40%)

Space Hunter is space shooter for Android. It was made during 2011/2012 as a school project. My first "big" programming project, the process was very much trial and error. For what it is I think the end result turned out quite nice.

Used to be available on Google Play Store, but they changed a bunch of rules and I couldn't be bothered to keep up.
